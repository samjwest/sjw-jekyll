It's always difficult starting from a blank canvas (or text editor). The words seem to get caught behind a dam of doubt. But, it is time to get this blog started. I'm just going to throw it out there. Consequences be damned.

It's kind of funny that I titled this the Initial Commit. Thought I was being so cleverâ€¦ Oh, not really. I had seen it in other places, but it was a good way to get started. The ironic thing is I wasn't clever enough to check my publish settings when I updated the web site and I blew away my content in the App_Data folder and had to recreate everything. I need to look into that idea of making backups.

I'm excited to work on this site. I'm still working on a plan, but I have a lot of ideas. Hopefully, this new chapter will find me with a bit of free time to devote to this. I am starting a new position with a company I'll talk more about in the future. It's going to allow me to focus on architecture and teams in a way that should translate well into content I can write about. But in the meantime, I've got more to set up with the site.
