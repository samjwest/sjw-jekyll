So apparently, I wasn't very committed to posting anything at all, let alone architectural topics! Somewhat in my defense, my hosting company performed some sort of migration and my sites never came back up. That was a few months ago. I've been busy.

The site is back up and I'm super excited. I've got a great opportunity with a new company. My oldest son graduated college in Texas, got married in Georgia, and is moving to California to begin a career in the GIS field. All that in the span of 2 months.

I feel better now that I have post #2 out. More will follow.
